Contains (almost) all of my problem set solutions for my machine learning class. 
Algorithms/Models:
- Primal SVMs
- Dual SVMs with slack (Gaussian kernel, rbf kernel, linear kernel)
- Decision trees
- Adaboost
- Coordinate descent
- PCA (Principle Component Analysis)
- k-means and an alternative k-means++ algorithm
- Logistic regression
- Gaussian Naiive Bayes
- Gaussian mixture models

Notes:
All of the prompts/instructions were removed to prevent scraping if the problems are to be re-used. 
PS1 solutions are not present as they were unfortunately lost.
All of the solutions for one problem set are combined together into a single file per set as they were adapted from google collab files.
